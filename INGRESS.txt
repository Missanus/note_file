Michael Pleshakov, Platform Integration Engineer, NGINX

The Ingress controller is one of the most critical parts of Kubernetes platform, acting as the entry point for all incoming traffic to applications running on Kubernetes.
 That’s why it must be built on top of a proven and reliable load‑balancing technology, such as NGINX. The NGINX Ingress controller combines the benefits of 
 using the Kubernetes control plane to manage load‑balancing configuration with the performance, reliability, and advanced features of NGINX or NGINX Plus.
 Additionally, the NGINX Ingress controller integrates NGINX with cloud‑native tools such as Helm and Prometheus, which are rapidly gaining adoption 
 in production Kubernetes environments.

This session is for beginning or intermediate Kubernetes users who are looking to deliver applications on Kubernetes in production.
 Michael shows how to successfully load balance HTTP as well as TCP/UDP applications on Kubernetes with NGINX Ingress controller. Topics include:

- Installation through Kubernetes manifests or Helm
- Configuration of load balancing for HTTP and TCP/UDP applications
- Monitoring using Prometheus
- Troubleshooting in case of problems
- Extensions that support advanced requirements
